  'DSNAME' IS A NAME OF JOL SOURCE DATA SET TO BE COMPILED.
))PINCLUDE SPECIFIES THAT ALL DATA INCLUDE WITH A JOL INCLUDE STATEMENT
    IS TO BE PRINTED.
))NPINCLUDE SPECIFIES THAT ALL DATA INCLUDE WITH A JOL INCLUDE STATEMENT
    IS NOT TO BE PRINTED.
))PMACRO    SPECIFIES THAT ANY MACROS OR COMMANDS ARE TO BE LISTED AS
    THEY ARE INTERPRETED.
))NPMACRO   SPECIFIES THAT ANY MACROS OR COMMANDS ARE NOT TO BE LISTED
    AS THEY ARE INTERPRETED.
))PEXPAND  SPECIFIES THAT THE GENERATED JOL STATAMENTS FROM JOL MACROS
    OR COMMANDS ARE TO BE PRINTED IN THE JOL COMPILER LISTING.
))NPEXPAND  SPECIFIES THAT THE GENERATED JOL STATAMENTS FROM JOL MACROS
    OR COMMANDS ARE NOT TO BE PRINTED IN THE JOL COMPILER LISTING.
))JOLSRCE('JOL INCLUDE LIBRARY') INDICATES THE NAME OF THE DATA SET TO
    BE USED IN THE COMPILE.
    ANY INCLUDE STATEMENT WILL USE THIS DATA SET TO INCLUDE DATA.
))LIST('DSNAME'/*) OR LIST   SPECIFIES THAT ASSEMBLY LISTING IS
    PRODUCED AND PLACED IN THE DATA SET SPECIFIED BY ('DSNAME')
    OR (*). HERE, * MEANS TO PLACE THE LISTING TO TERMINAL.

    IS USED.
))NOLIST   SPECIFIES THAT NO ASSEMBLY LISTING IS PRODUCED.
))MACLIB   SPECIFIES THAT SYSTEM STANDARD LIBRARY JOL32.CMDLIB IS USED.
))OBJECT('DSNAME') OR OBJECT   SPECIFIES THAT OBJECT MODULE IS PRODUCED
    IN THE DATA SET SPECIFIED BY 'DSNAME'. IF ('DSNAME') IS NOT PRESENT

))NOOBJECT   SPECIFIES THAT NO OBJECT MODULE IS PRODUCED.
))PRINT('DSNAME'/*) OR PRINT   SPECIFIES THAT ASSEMBLY LISTING IS
    PLACED IN THE DATA SET SPECIFIED BY ('DSNAME') OR (*). HERE, *
    MEANS TO PLACE THE LISTING TO TERMINAL. IF ('DSNAME') IS NOT
    SPECIFIED NOR (*), THE STANDARD DATA SET IS USED.
))SYSPRINT('SYSOUT CLASS') OR SYSPRINT   SPECIFIES THAT ASSEMBLY
    LISTING IS PRINTED THROUGH OUT THE SPECIFIED SYSOUT CLASS.

))NOPRINT   SPECIFIES THAT NO ASSEMBLY LISTING IS PLACED.
))SYMS('STRING')   INDICATES A CHARACTER STRING TO BE PASSED TO
    THE JOL COMPILER. THE NAMES SPECIFIED ARE INITIALISED TO THE
    VALUES SPECIFIED AND MAY BE REFERENCED AS ANY OTHER JOL SYMBOLIC
    PARAMETER OR VARIABLE.
))TERMINAL   SPECIFIES THAT DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION AND ERROR STATEMENTS
    ARE WRITTEN TO THE TERMINAL.

    STATEMENT ARE WRITTEN TO THE TERMINAL.
))TEST   SPECIFIES THAT THE GENERATED JCL IS NOT TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE
    OPERATING SYSTEM FOR EXECUTION.
))NOTEST   SPECIFIES THAT THE GENERATED JCL IS TO BE SUBMITTED TO
