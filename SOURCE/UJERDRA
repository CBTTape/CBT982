* THIS CSECT IS LINKED TO BY THE JOL COMPILER WHEN IT HAS TO PLACE A
*        JOB ON THE ASP JOBQ'S
* IT ISSUES A RDJFCB TO FIND THE DATA-SET-NAME ON WHICH THE GENERATED
*        JCL HAS BEEN PLACED, AND IT PICKS UP THE VOLUME INFORMATION
*        FROM THE JFCB AS WELL.
* THE 'ASP' ROUTINE IJPWTR ACTUALLY TRANSFERS THE JCL TO THE ASP
*        JOBQ.
