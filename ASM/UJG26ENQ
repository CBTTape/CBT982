****** NEW SEPT 14TH,1975
* THIS CSECT CALLS US26ENQ TO ENQUE ON AN INTERNAL READER.
* THERE IS A NEW VERSION OF US26ENQ BUT IT HAS TWO
* PROBLEMS AS FAR AS JOL IS CONCERNED
*   1. THE FILE MUST BE CLOSED BEFORE THE ENQ IS PERFORMED.
*      JOL KEEPS THE JCL FILE OPEN ALL THE TIME,
*      AND PRESUMABLY THE BUFFER NUMBER IS 1, AND THE FILE
*      NOT BLOCKED, SO THAT SHOULD BE ALRIGHT, BUT SHELL WILL
*      HAVE TO CHECK THAT.
*   2. I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHAT TO DO UNDER TSO WHEN I GET
*      A RETURN CODE FROM THE ENQUE THAT SAYS THE INTERNAL
*      READER IS ENQUED FRO A TSO JOL.
*****
* SO, THIS LITTLE ROUTINE CAN BE ALTERED LATTER WITHOUT ALTERING
* THE MAIN JOL COMPILER.
